# HooHacks
HooHacks Project

During the last hackathon, we worked on a text-based game that set attributes for a character. The user would make choices that could influence the character's health, happiness, caffeine level, etc. I used the character data stored in our last program to train a neural network to predict what attributes a character would have given if their major was stem or non-stem. Instead of doing typical data visualizations, my friend, Megan, drew sprite animations using pixilart, which I displayed based on the character traits predicted.  

For setup I used a python virtual environment with pygame for showing the sprite animations, pytorch for the neural network, and pandas/numpy for data processing.
